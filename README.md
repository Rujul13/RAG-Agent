# Building AI Agents and Workflows with LlamaIndex

This repository contains a series of hands-on exercises designed to guide you through the process of building sophisticated AI agents and multi-agent systems using the `llama-index` library. Starting from the basics of instantiating a language model, these notebooks progress to cover advanced topics like multi-agent collaboration, custom workflows with complex logic, and agentic self-reflection.

## ðŸš€ Core Concepts Covered

This tutorial walks through the fundamental building blocks of modern agentic systems:

-   **Basic LLM Interaction**: Setting up and making your first calls to an LLM.
-   **Agent Creation**: Building your first agent and equipping it with external tools (e.g., web search).
-   **State & Memory**: Using the `Context` object to maintain conversation history and manage state across interactions.
-   **Observability**: Streaming agent responses and monitoring the internal step-by-step reasoning process.
-   **Multi-Agent Systems**: Designing and orchestrating teams of specialized agents that collaborate to solve complex tasks.
-   **Custom Workflows**: Moving beyond pre-built agents to create bespoke workflows from scratch using `Workflow`, `@step`, and custom `Event`s.
-   **Advanced Flow Control**: Implementing complex logic like looping, conditional branching, and concurrency for map-reduce patterns.
-   **Self-Reflection**: Building agents that can critique their own work and iteratively refine their output.

## What I Learned from This Project

Through this project, I gained practical experience in building agentic AI systems from the ground up. I started with the fundamentals of interacting with an LLM via `llama-index` and quickly progressed to creating a functional agent equipped with custom tools and memory. I learned how to observe and debug an agent's internal state and decision-making process by tapping into its event stream.

The project then scaled up to designing complex, multi-agent systems where specialized agents collaborate to achieve a goal. A key takeaway was learning to architect custom, event-driven workflows from scratch, which enabled fine-grained control over the system's logic. This included implementing advanced patterns like conditional branching, loops for retries, and concurrent execution to run tasks in parallel. Finally, I implemented a sophisticated self-reflection loop, allowing an agent to review and iteratively improve its own output, which is a powerful pattern for enhancing the quality of generated results.
