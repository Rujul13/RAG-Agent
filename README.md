Building AI Agents and Workflows with LlamaIndex
This repository documents my project on building sophisticated AI agents and multi-agent systems using the llama-index library. In this project, I implemented a series of agentic systems, starting with foundational concepts and progressing to advanced patterns like multi-agent collaboration and self-reflection.

ðŸš€ Core Concepts Implemented
This project provided hands-on experience with the following fundamental building blocks of modern agentic systems:

Basic LLM Interaction: Setting up and making your first calls to an LLM.

Agent Creation: Building your first agent and equipping it with external tools (e.g., web search).

State & Memory: Using the Context object to maintain conversation history and manage state across interactions.

Observability: Streaming agent responses and monitoring the internal step-by-step reasoning process.

Multi-Agent Systems: Designing and orchestrating teams of specialized agents that collaborate to solve complex tasks.

Custom Workflows: Moving beyond pre-built agents to create bespoke workflows from scratch using Workflow, @step, and custom Events.

Advanced Flow Control: Implementing complex logic like looping, conditional branching, and concurrency for map-reduce patterns.

Self-Reflection: Building agents that can critique their own work and iteratively refine their output.

Project Summary
Through this project, I gained practical experience in building agentic AI systems from the ground up. I started with the fundamentals of interacting with an LLM via llama-index and quickly progressed to creating a functional agent equipped with custom tools and memory. I learned how to observe and debug an agent's internal state and decision-making process by tapping into its event stream.

The project then scaled up to designing complex, multi-agent systems where specialized agents collaborate to achieve a goal. A key takeaway was learning to architect custom, event-driven workflows from scratch, which enabled fine-grained control over the system's logic. This included implementing advanced patterns like conditional branching, loops for retries, and concurrent execution to run tasks in parallel. Finally, I implemented a sophisticated self-reflection loop, allowing an agent to review and iteratively improve its own output, which is a powerful pattern for enhancing the quality of generated results.
